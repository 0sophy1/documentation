    "## Solving valuable problems with quantum technology\n",
    "\n",
    "Many businesses would leap at the chance to go back in time to capitalize early on yesterday’s game-changing technologies, such as the internet. The chance to get ahead of the competition is here again with quantum computing. The technology is maturing, and now is the time to build your quantum skills and understand quantum’s immense potential for addressing computationally intensive problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the era of quantum computing, system performance will be key in achieving full quantum potential and scale—when we can definitively demonstrate, in certain use cases, a significant performance advantage over classical computers. Specifically, when a quantum computation is either hundreds or thousands of times faster, needs a smaller fraction of the memory, or makes something seemingly impossible possible. Our work with UC Berkeley demonstrates the power of currently available IBM Quantum processors to explore meaningful computations and realistic applications before the era of fault tolerance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum computers could soon solve valuable problems that have long challenged classical supercomputers. Governments and industry leaders worldwide are already exploring potential use cases in healthcare, materials science, machine learning, and more. Organizations that dive in now and become quantum ready will have a distinct advantage as these technologies evolve.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quantum readiness\n",
    "\n",
    "**Quantum readiness** is a continuously evolving measure of organizational proficiency in quantum computing strategy, technology and operations. It characterizes the company’s progressive capabilities to leverage quantum technology to disrupt industries, create competitive advantage, and respond to threats from quantum-savvy competitors.\n",

    "As described in *[The Quantum Decade](https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/institute-business-value/report/quantum-decade)*, quantum readiness is crucial because we help clients visualize and prepare to use the future computational power of quantum computing. IBM works with clients to build their skills and explore use cases with high business impact. Key insights can already be developed by executing use cases that are small enough to run on current quantum computers. As the technology continues to improve, our clients will grow the scope of these use cases and use quantum computing for business advantage.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next sections, we describe three ways organizations can build their capacity to disrupt industries, create competitive advantage, and respond to threats from quantum-savvy competitors. Organizations can invest in quantum workforce development, identify quantum use cases to capture business value, and protect against quantum threats.\n",

    "### Talent transformation\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum computing is completely different from conventional computing, right down to replacing the bit, the base unit of information. People who are open to new problem-solving approaches should be at the top of your list. Becoming quantum ready involves upskilling across various domains (see image below).\n",

    "\n",
    "A good use case is one that is expected to be of strategic importance to the business and that can be explored with available Qiskit routines — while also offering the flexibility to experiment as quantum technology advances. A risky or poor choice for a use case is one that requires a certain level of performance or relies on nascent academic theories to generate solutions that address a mission-critical or peripheral business problem.\n",

    "### Responsible Quantum Computing\n",
    "\n",
    "A use case should deliver business value and be responsible for its conception and execution. At IBM Quantum, we are committed to Responsible Quantum Computing, which is understood as developing quantum computing with an awareness of its power and potential impacts.\n",
    "\n",
    "IBM Quantum upholds five principles for developing quantum responsibly:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Make a positive societal impact.\n",
    "* Explore use cases with foresight.\n",
    "* Promote our products accurately.\n",
    "* Make consistent and transparent principled decisions.\n",
    "* Build a diverse and inclusive quantum community.\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ve built responsibility into our business practices. We have language in our contracts that requires IBM Quantum clients to use our quantum computers responsibly, and that they not use our quantum computers for nefarious or illegal purposes. We call these our responsible use and our acceptable use clauses.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<ImageLink\n",
    "  title=\"Responsible Quantum Computing\"\n",

    "As members of the quantum computing community, you make important decisions around which use cases you are exploring. We hope that you will participate in the responsible development of quantum computing, too.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Becoming quantum safe\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the ways in which we are protecting against the irresponsible development and deployment of quantum is with our IBM Quantum Safe offering, which helps organizations safeguard their data and systems from quantum cyberattacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "As quantum computers mature, they will present challenges to the classical encryption algorithms and protocols on which modern cybersecurity relies. While the risks are likely still years away, cybercriminals could be using “harvest now, decrypt later” schemes to harvest data today and store it until a powerful enough quantum computer can decrypt it. Meanwhile, data that clients are storing today may need to remain confidential for periods of up to 30 years or more.\n",
    "\n",
    "IBM has been pioneering in the research and development of quantum-safe security solutions. In collaboration with academic and industry partners, IBM researchers developed three of the four quantum-resistant encryption methods that the US Department of Commerce’s National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) selected to use as part of its post-quantum cryptographic standard, which they expect to implement by 2024. IBM researchers have also submitted three new digital signature schemes as candidates for standardization. We are so confident in these quantum-safe cryptographic solutions that we have already begun implementing them in our infrastructure, such as in z16, the world’s first quantum-safe mainframe, and IBM Cloud. Now, with IBM Quantum Safe technology and services, we are leveraging that expertise to help clients make the transition to quantum-safe cryptography.\n",
