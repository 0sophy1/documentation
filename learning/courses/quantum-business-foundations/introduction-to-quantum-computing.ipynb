    "\n",
    "Quantum computing harnesses the laws of quantum mechanics to solve complex mathematical problems. When scientists and engineers encounter tough problems, they typically turn to supercomputers—large classical computers with thousands of central processing units (CPUs) and graphics processing units (GPUs). However, while classical supercomputers are very good at solving certain types of problems, they struggle to solve problems with many variables interacting in complicated ways. Quantum technology could help us push past these barriers of complexity to address important problems across industries worldwide.\n",

A recent report by the IBM Institute for Business Value, *[The Quantum Decade](https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/institute-business-value/report/quantum-decade)*, outlines major drivers for this next generation of computing. Consider these aspects in evaluating quantum for your business:\n",

    "What makes quantum computing extraordinary is its capacity to solve today’s unsolvable problems, ultimately delivering business value. Quantum computing can explore these problems because it is based on quantum mechanics, which is the deepest explanation of reality available. Quantum computing exploits quantum mechanical phenomena to process information.\n",
    "\n",
    "While some may consider quantum computing an innovative area at the beginning of its life cycle, the reality is that the theory underlying quantum computing has been evolving since at least the 1970s. It is important to recognize some of the key milestones and breakthroughs over time, as what was previously measured in inches of progress has rapidly progressed from science to systems.\n",

    "| <em>1970</em> | Charles H. Bennett may have been the first person to write the phrase “quantum information theory” on February 24, 1970, while working as a research scientist at IBM. His note was a harbinger of the tremendous work by many others that would follow, leading the world onto the path toward quantum advantage.|\n",
    "| <em>1981</em> | Richard Feynman, a noted theoretical physicist, identified the potential for quantum computers as far back as 1981. At the first Conference on the Physics of Computation, organized by IBM and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), he famously closed his keynote speech with the statement “[...] nature isn’t classical, dammit, and if you want to make a simulation of nature, you’d better make it quantum mechanical, and by golly it’s a wonderful problem, because it doesn’t look so easy.” [1]|\n",
    "| <em> 1994 </em> | In 1994, Peter Shor, a mathematician then at AT&amp;T Bell Labs in New Jersey, proved that a fully functional quantum computer could do something remarkable: it could crack RSA encryption, a popular means of securing private communications. He showed that his quantum algorithm could do in minutes what might take a regular computer the lifetime of the universe to unravel. <sup>2</sup>|\n",
    "| <em> 1996 </em> | A year later, Lov Grover, also a Bell Labs scientist, came up with a quantum algorithm that would allow people to swiftly search unstructured databases. Scientists piled into the field, and advances in hardware soon followed the breakthroughs in code. [2]|\n",
    "| <em> 1998 </em> | The first experimental demonstration of a quantum algorithm was achieved in 1998. A working 2–qubit nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) quantum computer was used to solve Deutsch’s problem by Jonathan A. Jones and Michele Mosca at Oxford University and shortly after by Isaac L. Chuang at IBM’s Almaden Research Center and Mark Kubinec and the University of California, Berkeley, together with coworkers at Stanford University and MIT. [3]|\n",
    "| <em> 2001 </em> | 2001 saw the first execution of Shor’s algorithm at IBM’s Almaden Research Center and Stanford University. The number 15 was factored using 1018 identical molecules, each containing seven active nuclear spins. [4]|\n",
    "| <em> 2005 </em> | By the mid–2000s, the research field had developed several types of superconducting qubits, each with its own advantages and drawbacks. In 2007, a team at Yale found a way to combine some of these approaches to overcome their individual shortcomings, naming the new design the “transmon qubit.” The transmon qubit would go on to be at the heart of many companies’ efforts to develop quantum computers, including IBM Quantum, Google AI, and Rigetti Computing. A member of the Yale team, Jay Gambetta, later became Vice President of Quantum Computing for IBM Research. |\n",

    "It’s not easy to predict when exactly quantum computing will be able to outperform methods in use today. Yet, to lead in the rapidly approaching age of quantum computing and address complex problems, businesses and research organizations need to start preparing now. Due to the steep learning curve, an early start on learning and experimentation can prove a competitive advantage. Quantum computing readiness is a continuously evolving state that depends on an organization’s approach to and investment in innovation, as well as new talent and skills, and overall digital maturity. Readiness includes adoption of enabling technologies such as automation, AI, and hybrid multi-cloud; willingness to analyze, experiment, and iterate with expanding computing capabilities; the sophistication of workflows; and organizational skill set."
